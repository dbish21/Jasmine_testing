   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers and servers.

2. What is a URL?
   A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It typically includes the protocol, domain name, and path to a specific page or resource.

3. What is DNS?
   DNS (Domain Name System) is like a phonebook for the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

4. What is a query string?
   A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to web applications. It comes after the "?" in a URL and consists of key-value pairs separated by "&" (e.g., ?key1=value1&key2=value2).

5. What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
   Two common HTTP verbs are GET and POST:
   - GET: Used to request data from a server. Parameters are sent in the URL.
   - POST: Used to submit data to be processed by the server. Data is sent in the request body, not in the URL.

6. What is an HTTP request?
   An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (usually a web browser) to a server, asking for information or to perform an action. It includes the request method, headers, and sometimes a body.

7. What is an HTTP response?
   An HTTP response is the server's reply to an HTTP request. It contains the requested information or confirmation of the requested action, along with status codes and headers.

8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
   HTTP headers are additional pieces of information sent with requests and responses. They provide metadata about the message.
   Examples:
   - Request headers: User-Agent, Accept, Cookie
   - Response headers: Content-Type, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

9. What are the processes that happen when you type "http://somesite.com/some/page.html" into a browser?
   1. The browser performs a DNS lookup to find the IP address for somesite.com.
   2. It establishes a TCP connection with the server at that IP address.
   3. The browser sends an HTTP GET request for /some/page.html.
   4. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
   5. The browser receives the response and renders the HTML content.
   6. The browser may make additional requests for resources like images or scripts referenced in the HTML.
